#25、更多的练习（2018-03-20，1h）



###课程目标：

* 转义序列的复习；
* 函数多参数的使用方法；



###课程内容：

新建文件“ex24.py”，输入如下内容并运行：

```
print "Let's practice everything."
print 'You\'d need to know \'bout escapes with \\ that do \n newlines and \t tabs.'

poem = """
\tThe lovely world
with logic so firmly planted
cannot discern \n the needs of love
nor comprehend passion from intuition
and requires an explanation
\n\t\twhere there is none.
"""

print "--------------"
print poem
print "--------------"


five = 10 - 2 + 3 - 6
print "This should be five: %s" % five

def secret_formula(started):
    jelly_beans = started * 500
    jars = jelly_beans / 1000
    crates = jars / 100
    return jelly_beans, jars, crates


start_point = 10000
beans, jars, crates = secret_formula(start_point)

print "With a starting point of: %d" % start_point
print "We'd have %d beans, %d jars, and %d crates." % (beans, jars, crates)

start_point = start_point / 10

print "We can also do that this way:"
print "We'd have %d beans, %d jars, and %d crates." % secret_formula(start_point)
```



返回：

```
$ python ex24.py
Let's practice everything.
You'd need to know 'bout escapes with \ that do
 newlines and   tabs.
--------------

       The lovely world
with logic so firmly planted
cannot discern
 the needs of love
nor comprehend passion from intuition
and requires an explanation

              where there is none.

--------------
This should be five: 5
With a starting point of: 10000
We'd have 5000000 beans, 5000 jars, and 50 crates.
We can also do that this way:
We'd have 500000 beans, 500 jars, and 5 crates.
```



###函数多参数的调用方法

* 给返回值定义参数；
* 函数参数与定义参数无关联；

```
def test(started):
	a = started * 1
	b = started * 2
	c = started * 3 
	return a,b,c

num = 1
e,f,g = test(num)

print "we'd have %d beans, %d jars, and %d crates." % test(num)
```



###附加题：

1. 记得仔细检查结果，从后往前倒着检查，把代码朗读出来，在不清楚的位置加上注释。

   done

2. 故意把代码改错，运行并检查会发生什么样的错误，并且确认你有能力改正这些错误。

​      

```
def test(started):
	a = 1
	b = 2
	c = 3 
	return a,b,c

print "we'd have %d beans, %d jars, and %d crates." % test(started)
```

返回错误：

```
$ python ex24.py
Traceback (most recent call last):
  File "ex24.py", line 51, in <module>
    a,b,c = test(started)
NameError: name 'started' is not defined
```



未定义和输入started参数，修改为：

```
def test(started):
	a = 1
	b = 2
	c = 3 
	return a,b,c

num = 1
e,f,g = test(num)

print "we'd have %d beans, %d jars, and %d crates." % test(num)
```



函数参数可以不用和返回有更合关联， 也可以重新定义函数返回值对用的参数。
