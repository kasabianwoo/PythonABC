#31、else 和 if（2018-03-26，h） 



###课程目标：

* elif 和 else 的用法；



###课程内容：

```
people = 30
cars = 40
trucks = 15


if cars > people:
    print "We should take the cars."
elif cars < people:
    print "We should not take the cars."
else:
    print "We can't decide."

if trucks > cars:
    print "That's too many trucks."
elif trucks < cars:
    print "Maybe we could take the trucks."
else:
    print "We still can't decide."

if people > trucks:
    print "Alright, let's just take the trucks."
else:
    print "Fine, let's stay home then."
```



返回结果：

```
$ python ex30.py
we should take the cars.
maybe we could take the trucks.
allright,let's just take the trucks
```



###附加题：

1. 想一下`elif` 和 `else` 的功能。

   elif：并列 if

   else：其他、剩余

   ​

2. 将 `cars`, `people`, 和 `buses` 的数量改掉，然后追溯每一个 `if` 语句。看看最后会打印出什么来。

   ```
   people = 30
   cars = 30
   trucks = 40 

   返回：

   $ python ex30.py
   we cant't decide.
   that's too many trucks
   fine,let's stay home then
   ```

   ​

3. 试着写一些复杂的布尔表达式，例如 `cars > people` 和 `buses < cars`等。

   ```
   people = 30
   cars = 30
   trucks = 40

   if trucks > cars and trucks + cars <= people :
   	print "maybe we could take the trucks."
   else:
   	print "fine,let's stay home then"
   ```

   ​

4. 给每一行加上注释，解释每一句代码是什么功能。

​        done.
