# 8、更多的打印与输出（2018-01-30）



### 课程目标：

* 练习之前的学习内容



### 课程内容：

新建文件“ex6.py”，输入如下代码并运行：

```
print "Mary had a little lamb."
print "Its fleece was white as %s." % 'snow'
print "And everywhere that Mary went."
print "." * 10  # what'd that do?

end1 = "C"
end2 = "h"
end3 = "e"
end4 = "e"
end5 = "s"
end6 = "e"
end7 = "B"
end8 = "u"
end9 = "r"
end10 = "g"
end11 = "e"
end12 = "r"

# watch that comma at the end.  try removing it to see what happens
print end1 + end2 + end3 + end4 + end5 + end6,
print end7 + end8 + end9 + end10 + end11 + end12
```

显示如下

```
$ python ex7.py
Mary had a little lamb.
Its fleece was white as snow.
And everywhere that Mary went.
..........
Cheese Burger
```



### 返回错误：

在中文状态下输入的单引号



### 附加题：



1.逆向阅读，给每一行的加上注释。 

done


2.倒着朗读出来，找出自己的错误。 

检查你的代码！


3.从现在开始，把你犯过的错误记录一张纸上。 

done


4.在开始下一节习题时，阅读一遍你记录下来的错误，并且尽量避免在下个练习中再犯同样的错误。 
done


5.记住，每个人都会犯错误。程序员和魔术师一样，他们希望大家认为他们从不犯错，不过这只是表象而已，他们每时每刻都在犯错。
