# 10、打印、打印、打印（2018-02-03）



### 课程目标：

- 更多的打印、格式化字符串的练习



### 课程内容：

新建文件“ex9.py”，输入如下内容并运行：

```
# Here's some new strange stuff, remember type it exactly.

days = "Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun"
months = "Jan\nFeb\nMar\nApr\nMay\nJun\nJul\nAug"

print "Here are the days: ", days
print "Here are the months: ", months

print """
There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
"""
```

得到结果：

```
$ python ex9.py
Here are the days:  Mon Tue Wed Thu Fri Sat Sun
Here are the months:  Jan
Feb
Mar
Apr
May
Jun
Jul
Aug

There's something going on here.
With the three double-quotes.
We'll be able to type as much as we like.
Even 4 lines if we want, or 5, or 6.
```





### 附加题：



1.自己检查结果，记录你犯过的错误，并且在下个练习中尽量不犯同样的错误。
